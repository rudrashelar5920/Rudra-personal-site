          <h3>Computer and Programming</h3>
          <p>I love computer and programming. I started programming when I was 11 years old. I thougth that how computers work and I came across with some coding class ads and websites, but they were very expensive. 
           However first I tried with free class. It was so exciting. So I searched for more in youtube and then I understood that it needs various programs and they were in different Programming languages.
           Hence I decided to learn something new so I started to search free courses and then i got IT basics course and I started to learn it and at last I got certificate of IT basic. 
           It was my first success and next I started coding fundamentals. I also got the cerfificate of the same.
           After and I saw that the courses are so great available at less cost on a site.
           So I started the The Web Devlopment Bootcamp And this website is a part of the course.
           So this was my journey to computers and programming.
